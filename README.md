This is my portfolio website made in vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I wanted to see how websites are made without using any library or framework in javascript.

Let's be clear here, if you're starting out and just want to copy this website completely and just paste your name and description please don't. Make changes in the website as much as possible, try to experiment with the design, buttons and overall theme, you'll learn much more by doing so.

I didn't make this website all by myself, this website is a modification of Modern CV by Coder's Gyan.

Thank you so much bro for the guide.
